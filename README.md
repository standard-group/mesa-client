# Project Mesa Client

This is the client-side code for the Project Mesa desktop application. It is built using Vue.js + Vite and Tauri.

> Why you choose Tauri?

Tauri offers almost the same functionality as Electron, but with a more modern, faster and low-memory eater. It also has a better developer experience, as it is written in Rust and uses the WebView2 API for rendering.

## Getting Started

To install and run the client, go grab our latest release from [here](https://github.com/standard-group/mesa-client/releases/latest) for your platform. 

If you want nightly builds, you can find them [here for desktop](https://github.com/standard-group/mesa-client/actions/workflows/desktop.yml) and [here for mobile (Android)](https://github.com/standard-group/mesa-client/actions/workflows/mobile.yml).
